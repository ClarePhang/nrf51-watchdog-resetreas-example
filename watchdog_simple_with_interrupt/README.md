Watchdog simple example with interrupt
==================

 This project contains code examples that show watchdog functionality, compatible with either nRF51 or nRF52 ICs.
 
Requirements
------------
- nRF5 SDK version 11.0.0
- nRF51-DK or nRF52-DK development kits

The project may need modifications to work with other versions or other boards. 

To compile it, or clone the repository into \nRF5_SDK_11.0.0_89a8197\examples\ folder, or place any project folder (e.g. watchdog_simple folder) into \nRF5_SDK_11.0.0_89a8197\examples\peripheral\ folder.

Furter exmplanation on how the examples work is documented at the top of the main file in the example in question.

About this project
------------------
This application is one of several applications that has been built by the support team at Nordic Semiconductor, as a demo of some particular feature or use case. It has not necessarily been thoroughly tested, so there might be unknown issues. It is hence provided as-is, without any warranty. 

However, in the hope that it still may be useful also for others than the ones we initially wrote it for, we've chosen to distribute it here on GitHub. 

The application is built to be used with the official nRF5 SDK, that can be downloaded from http://developer.nordicsemi.com/
